## Viewing Debug Logs

### Quick Method

#### 1. Claude Desktop Logs (macOS)

```bash
# View latest logs in real-time
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log

# Or via Console.app (GUI)
open -a Console
# Then find Claude Desktop logs
```

#### 2. Cursor IDE Logs (macOS)

```bash
# View latest logs in real-time
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Cursor/*.log
```

#### 3. Run Server Directly for Debugging

The easiest way to see all logs - run the server directly in terminal:

```bash
cd <path-to-project>

# Set environment variables
export OPENL_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080/rest"
export OPENL_USERNAME="admin"
export OPENL_PASSWORD="admin"
export OPENL_CLIENT_DOCUMENT_ID="debug-1"

# Run the server
node dist/index.js
```

All logs will be visible directly in the terminal! Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### Detailed Debugging

#### Enable Verbose Logging

For more detailed logs, set the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
export DEBUG=1
export NODE_ENV=development
node dist/index.js
```

#### Search for Specific Errors

**OpenL Connection Errors:**
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log | grep -i "openl\|401\|unauthorized\|connection"
```


**Configuration Errors:**
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log | grep -i "config\|environment\|missing"
```

### Log Structure

All MCP server logs have prefixes for easy filtering:

- `[Config]` - configuration logs
- `[Auth]` - authentication logs
- `[Browser]` - browser interaction logs
- `[Error]` - errors

**Example Log Filtering:**
```bash
# Errors only
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log | grep "\[Error\]"


# Configuration logs only
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log | grep "\[Config\]"
```

### Server Health Checks

#### Test 1: Build Check

```bash
cd <path-to-project>
npm run build
```

If build is successful, there will be no errors.

#### Test 2: Configuration Check

```bash
# Check Claude Desktop configuration
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/config.json | jq '.mcpServers["openl-mcp-server"]'
```

#### Test 3: OpenL Connection Check

```bash
curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8080/rest/repository
```

If OpenL is running, you'll get JSON with repositories.

#### Test 4: Run Server with Verification

```bash
cd <path-to-project>

# Set environment variables from your configuration
export OPENL_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080/rest"
export OPENL_USERNAME="admin"
export OPENL_PASSWORD="admin"
export OPENL_CLIENT_DOCUMENT_ID="test-1"

# Run the server
node dist/index.js
```

You should see initialization logs:
```
[Config] Loading configuration from environment variables...
[Config] Authentication methods:
[Config]   - API Key: not configured
[Config]   - Basic Auth: configured (username: admin)
```

If the server starts without errors, everything is working correctly.

### Useful Commands

**View last 100 lines of logs:**
```bash
tail -n 100 ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log
```

**Search for all errors in the last hour:**
```bash
grep -i error ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log | tail -20
```

**Monitor logs in real-time:**
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log | grep --color=always -E "error|Error|ERROR|\[Error\]|\[Auth\]|\[Config\]"
```

**Save logs to file:**
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log > mcp-debug.log 2>&1
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "require is not defined"

**Solution:** Make sure the project is rebuilt:
```bash
cd <path-to-project>
npm run build
```

### Issue: "Unexpected token 'C', '[Config] Lo'... is not valid JSON"

**Solution:** This means logs are going to stdout. Make sure you're using the latest code where all logs go to stderr via `console.error()`.

### Issue: Server doesn't start

**Solution:** Check logs directly:
```bash
cd <path-to-project>
node dist/index.js 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```

Then open `debug.log` to view all errors.

### Issue: No logs in Claude Desktop

**Solution:** 
1. Make sure Claude Desktop is completely restarted (not just minimized)
2. Check that logging is enabled in Claude Desktop settings
3. Try running the server directly to verify

### Issue: MCP Server doesn't appear in AI client

**Solution:**
1. Check path to `dist/index.js` (must be absolute)
2. Ensure project is built: `npm run build`
3. Restart your AI client

### Issue: "Cannot connect to OpenL API"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure OpenL Tablets is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/rest/projects
   ```
2. Check `OPENL_BASE_URL` in configuration
3. Ensure URL ends with `/rest` (not `/rest/` - trailing slash is incorrect)

### Issue: "Authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Check credentials (`OPENL_USERNAME`, `OPENL_PASSWORD`)
2. Try logging into OpenL via browser with the same credentials
3. Ensure user has necessary permissions

### Issue: Tools don't work in chat

**Solution:**
1. Check MCP server status in settings (should be "Connected")
2. Try explicitly asking the AI to use the tool
3. Check logs for errors

## Connection Issues

### Issue: Docker containers don't start

**Solution:**
1. Check that Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
2. Check ports (8080, 5432 should not be occupied):
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   lsof -i :5432
   ```
3. View logs:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   ```

### Issue: Port 3000 occupied (Docker)

**Solution:**
Change port in `compose.yaml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "3001:3000"  # External:Internal
```

Or set environment variable:
```yaml
environment:
  PORT: 3001
```

## Configuration Issues

### Issue: File doesn't exist

**Solution:**
1. Ensure project is built:
   ```bash
   cd <path-to-project>
   npm run build
   ls -la dist/index.js  # Should exist
   ```
2. Verify the path in configuration matches the actual location

### Issue: Environment variables not set

**Solution:**
1. Check configuration file for your AI client
2. Ensure all required variables are set:
   - `OPENL_BASE_URL` (required)
   - At least one authentication method (username/password, API key, or OAuth2)
3. Restart your AI client after changing configuration

---

## Additional Information

- All MCP server logs go to **stderr** (via `console.error()`) to avoid interfering with JSON-RPC protocol on stdout
- AI client logs are automatically saved to their respective log directories
- For debugging, it's recommended to run the server directly in terminal
- Use `DEBUG=1` environment variable for more verbose logs
